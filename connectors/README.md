# Connectors Documentation

This directory provides documentation and references for building and configuring **connectors** in the Luther Platform ecosystem.

## ConnectorHub Overview

ConnectorHub is the central component that enables seamless, event-driven integration between enterprise systems and Lutherâ€™s Common Operations Script (_phylum_). It manages all cross-system requests, routes events to external services via connectors, and ensures secure, auditable process automation across organizational boundaries.

- For a detailed introduction, see [connectorhub.md](./connectorhub.md).

A connector is a reusable integration to a third-party system (e.g., Equifax, Postgres, Stripe, Camunda, AWS SES, Invoice Ninja, GoCardless, etc.). The platform supports a growing catalog of connectors, which can be enabled, mocked, or configured in your projectâ€™s `fabric/connectorhub.yml` file.
