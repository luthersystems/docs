# Frequently Asked Questions

## ðŸ§© General

### What happens if a system I want to add isnâ€™t on the connector list?

No problem! Click **"Canâ€™t find connector"** on the Add Connector screen.
Itâ€™ll walk you through a few quick questions so we can start building the
connector you need. Weâ€™ll even give you **$500 in platform credit** for any new
connector request.

### Can I contribute to building connectors?

Absolutely! Weâ€™re in the process of open-sourcing **ConnectorHub**, which
includes an SDK to help you build and contribute new connectors.

### Can Cursor suggest sample code for my application?

Yes! After onboarding, we spin up a **preconfigured repo** for you. Cursor is
fully set up to help and uses the `docs/` directory and built-in examples to
suggest relevant, modifiable code tailored to your app.

## ðŸ§  ELPS

### Is there a list of built-in ELPS functions?

Yes â€” check out:  
[elps/lisp/builtins.go](https://github.com/luthersystems/elps/blob/master/lisp/builtins.go)

---

### Can I require arguments when using key-argument style?

Partially â€” you can require arguments by specifying them first. Thereâ€™s no way
to make key-arguments themselves required.

---

### What does `default` do?

It returns the second argument if the first is `nil` or `false`. Otherwise, it
returns the first argument.

---

### Can I call Go code from ELPS?

Yes â€” see the embedding guide:  
[elps/docs/embed.md](https://github.com/luthersystems/elps/blob/master/docs/embed.md)

---

### Whatâ€™s the difference between `[` and `(`?

They are functionally equivalent â€” just syntactic sugar to help with readability.

---

### How does `now` work in ELPS?

`now` is an RFC3339 timestamp set by `shiroclient`. Itâ€™s consistent across all
simulations of a transaction, ensuring deterministic behavior.
