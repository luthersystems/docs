Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on VS Code. It helps you write, understand, and modify code faster by letting you chat with your codebase, ask questions, and get intelligent suggestions ‚Äî all inside the editor.
üëâ We've already set up the GitHub repo to work great with Cursor ‚Äî just follow the steps below to get started quickly.

#### Step 1: Install Cursor

Go to https://www.cursor.so
Click "Download Cursor" and install it for your OS (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
Once installed, launch Cursor.

#### Step 2: Create a Cursor Account

When prompted, sign in using your GitHub or Google account.
If it asks for permission to access GitHub repos, allow it (you can adjust access scope later).

#### Step 3: Clone the Sandbox Repo

In Cursor, open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).
Type "Git: Clone" and hit Enter.
Paste this repo URL:
{{REPO_LINK}}

Choose a folder where you'd like to save the repo.
After it's cloned, Cursor may ask if you want to open the cloned repo ‚Äî click "Open".

#### Step 4: Trust the Workspace

If you get a prompt saying ‚ÄúDo you trust the authors of the files in this folder?‚Äù ‚Äî click Yes.

#### Step 5: Let Cursor Index the Codebase

Cursor will automatically start indexing the code.
You may see a message saying "Preparing your workspace" or "Indexing files" ‚Äî wait for it to finish (you‚Äôll be able to use AI while it loads).

#### Step 6: Start Coding or Ask Questions

Use Cmd+K then Enter to open the AI Chat.
You can also highlight code, right-click, and choose "Ask Cursor" for help.
Or press Cmd+I (Ctrl+I on Windows) to trigger inline AI suggestions.
