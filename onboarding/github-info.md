### **Your GitHub Project – Code, Test, and Deploy with Zero Setup**

Luther Systems sets up a **dedicated GitHub repository** for your project, preloaded with our **sandbox application** as a starting point. This environment is fully configured for **modern, AI-assisted development** and cloud-native deployment — so you can get started writing business logic immediately.

---

### **What’s Already Set Up For You**

- **1-Click GitHub Codespaces**: Launch a fully configured development environment directly in your browser — no software installation required.
- **Optimized for AI Coding Tools (Cursor and Copilot)**: Context is preloaded and structured to work seamlessly with AI assistants for faster, smarter code suggestions.
- **Integrated with Substrate in AWS**: Your GitHub project is directly connected to the running platform — when you commit changes, your updated process logic is deployed automatically.

---

### **Automated Workflows Included**

We configure **GitHub Actions** to streamline your development workflow:

- **Test Pipeline**: Runs unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests on every pull request to ensure quality.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automatically deploys your application to your cloud environment whenever changes are merged to `main`, provided all tests pass.

---

### **Code = Process**

With this setup, your business process becomes code — version-controlled, testable, and repeatable. Whether you're building a claims pipeline, settlement process, or operational task flow, **you can now operate the most complex processes, as code.**

All of this is managed and maintained by the Luther team — so you can focus on logic, not infrastructure.
