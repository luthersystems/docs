#### **Each server has storage that records the events executed for your process. Events typically range from 20â€“200KB depending on how much processing your operations perform. As your product scales, you can increase storage size over time.**

Each node is assigned an **Amazon EBS volume** (using the cost-efficient, throughput-optimized `sc1` class), which is the **only source of persistent data** in the stack. These volumes store:

- The full **history of structured events** emitted by the common operations script (COS), stored in LevelDB.
- The **current state data** read and written by the COS as it drives your process.

By default, **each node stores a replica of the event history**, providing **active-active data replication** across the platform.

Volumes are provisioned via Kubernetes **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**, support **dynamic resizing**, and are formatted with the **ext4** filesystem. They are located in an **availability zone based on your selected region**, and are protected with **full-disk encryption using AWS KMS-managed keys** for security.

**Optional features** such as **PVC snapshots** and **cross-zone replication** can be enabled for added redundancy and recovery, with additional storage costs.
