### **Substrate – Executes Your Process Logic Reliably and Consistently**

To run your business process end-to-end, we’ve built a secure and efficient execution engine called **Substrate**, which is installed on every node in your deployment. Substrate is responsible for executing the **common operations script (COS)** — a unified, functional representation of your entire process — in a way that is scalable, deterministic, and fault-tolerant.

### **Why We Designed It This Way**

We’ve chosen this architecture to deliver **operational simplicity**, **robustness**, and **system-wide consistency**. Instead of asking each system to manage its own logic, all nodes execute the same shared script. This ensures that **all teams and their systems remain in sync** — no divergence, no duplication.

The result is:

- **Reliability**: Every action follows the same logic, reviewed and versioned in one place.
- **Simplicity**: You only manage one script — no custom deployments per system.
- **Resilience**: The platform safely retries, resumes, and recovers from failures without manual intervention.

You also **don’t have to worry about parallel programming or concurrency control** — Substrate manages execution across nodes, coordinating events, state, and system responses. Your logic remains clean and easy to follow.

### **How Substrate Executes Your Process**

Each Substrate instance:

- **Pulls the latest approved script** from your GitHub repository.
- Maintains an **active connection to your enterprise systems**.
- Enters a **continuous operations loop** that:
  1. Evaluates the current state of the process.
  2. Determines the next step based on the script.
  3. **Sends outbound requests to ConnectorHub**, which is configured using your specific connection credentials and settings.
  4. Listens for and validates responses from external systems.
  5. Stores the results in LevelDB, contributing to the durable event history and current state.

This loop is **idempotent, resilient, and deterministic**, ensuring that your process executes consistently — regardless of restarts, delays, or network issues.

### **Fully Managed, Zero Ops**

You don’t have to manage or deploy any of this yourself. Substrate is:

- **Automatically provisioned** on each processing node.
- **Kept up-to-date** via GitHub integration.
- **Monitored and maintained** as part of your managed infrastructure.

We handle the complexity — including concurrency, failure recovery, and state synchronization — so your team can focus on defining processes that work across teams and systems.
