# 2.2. Data Model

1. **Entities** In data modelling (a first step in the creation of a database), an entity is some unit of data that can be classified and have stated relationships to other entities.&#x20;
2. **Attributes** In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such.
3. **Entity Relationship Diagram** An entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database. An entity in this context is an object, a component of data.
