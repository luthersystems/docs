# 2.1. Architecture Diagram

1. **Physical Architecture Diagram** At the lowest level of abstraction the physical architecture diagram (PAD) shows the physical structure of some or all of a system at a particular level. The PAD shows the physical flows between the system components at the level of interest.
2. **Logical Architecture Diagram** The logical architecture is considered a type of structural design that is used to provide a detailed description of the system without defining the system technology or environment. It includes all the information related logically and detailed description without using technical terms in it. It means it can be considered a diagram used to define the relation between the software components. The main purpose of designing logical architecture is to plan for the system and use it for communication before designing and implementing the system. And by this diagram, the user can get an overview of the system.
