# 4. Luther Stack Setup

Once you have deployed your infrastructure and platform, you are now ready to begin developing your application.\
\
By taking the process map you created in step 1, and speaking to the Product/Process Owner, you should now create some feature documentation in the form of User Stories or Product Requirement Documents (PRD's) for your development team to know what to build in the application.\
\
If you need help in process discovery, process mapping, requirement gathering, and agile project delivery, then use Luther's Professional Services to call on our experienced team for support.
