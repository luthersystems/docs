| Phrase Matching                     | Applications which process data from an external source will normally have to complete some data transformation and standardisation. This microservice enables a developer to easily configure phrase matching for their application so that they can normalise phase entries against a canonical source (standard dictionary).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Strong Hashing                      | For applications which need to be able to compare data without sharing the contents of the data, this library enables a developer to easily create a hash (randomized mathematical output of numbers) of the data for increased data security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| GDPR Compliance                     | GDPR compliance requires the ability for data subjects to have their data removed under certain circumstances. This requirement poses unique challenges to blockchain technology since this technology uses immutable ledgers which do not support data deletion. To address this requirement, we have developed a mechanism for messages to be transformed into an encrypted form prior to being processed by smart contracts and stored on the blockchain. Through use of this module, data is always stored on the blockchain in an encrypted form. Data is subsequently deleted via cryptoshredding technique which involves destroying off-chain encryption keys, effectively erasing the data. |
