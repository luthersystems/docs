# 6.2. Smart Contract Development

For Smart Contract development and testing we recommend following Test-Driven-Development (TDD) principles:

1. Write unit (elps) test for new business logic feature and check test fails
2. Write new business logic feature (Smart Contract),  and use **Platform Modules** in business logic If feature includes any
3. Confirm unit (elps) tests pass
